This repository contains some scripts I used to analyze data from /r/HongKong, /r/Hong_Kong, /r/Sino, and /r/China.

The majority of the data was collected and processed by my [Tree Grab for Reddit](https://github.com/mcandocia/TreeGrabForReddit) scripts. I do not have all of them updated yet, as I am currently working on a project that is changing them quite frequently.
